# Basic git functionalities 🔩

- **`git init`** initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory. It adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that houses the internal data structure required for version control.
- **`git clone`** creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project’s files, history, and branches.
- **`git add`** stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer’s codebase, but it’s necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project’s history. This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step process. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the project’s history. Staging and committing separately gives developers complete control over the history of their project without changing how they code and work.
- **`git commit`** saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything that’s been staged with `**git add**` will become a part of the snapshot with `**git commit**`.
- **`git status`** shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
- **`git branch`** shows the branches being worked on locally.
- **`git merge`** merges lines of development together. This command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches. For example, a developer would merge when they want to combine changes from a feature branch into the main branch for deployment.
- **`git pull`** updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this command if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they would like to reflect those changes in their local environment.
- **`git push`** updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.
